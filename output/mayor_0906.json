This month, we\u0092re shining a spotlight on the artists, performers, and creators who fill our city with energy and culture. From concerts to film festivals, fashion shows to art installations, 202Creates is a\r\n tribute to the talent that makes DC the true creative capital. DC\u0092s creative scene isn\u0092t just about entertainment; it\u0092s a driving force behind our city\u0092s growth and success. With a $13.8 billion creative economy,\r\n the arts are creating jobs, building community, and putting DC on the map as a global leader in innovation. We're proud that Marvel Studios makes superhero movies here, and that Oscar-nominated actors like Jeffrey Wright were born and raised in DC. And we're\r\n especially proud of the creatives who work in our schools and across DC Government and who have studios and businesses in DC. As we gather for events like Art All Night , Theatre Week and DC Fashion Week , H Street Festival and so many more, let\u0092s continue to support and uplift those who make DC the capital of creativity. I encourage everyone to explore the full calendar of 202Creates events at 202creates.com and find new ways to connect with our city\u0092s creative community.
